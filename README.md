# Computational Statistics Project
HSMW-Comp.Stat.-Project

The main objective of my statistical analysis is to determine if the nominees and
winners of the Academy Awards follow any zodiacal patterns, i.e. if
there is a sign that is most likely to win/be nominated and what are the most
nominated and awarded zodiac signs and whether there is a dependence between the nominated 
zodiac signs and the awarded ones.
